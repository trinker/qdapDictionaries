\href{http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/}{From Grady Ward's Moby project:}
"This second edition is a particularly thorough revision of the original Moby
Part-of-Speech. Beyond the fifteen thousand new entries, many thousand more
entries have been scrutinized for correctness and modernity. This is
unquestionably the largest P-O-S list in the world. Note that the many included
phrases means that parsing algorithms can now tokenize in units larger than a
single word, increasing both speed and accuracy."
