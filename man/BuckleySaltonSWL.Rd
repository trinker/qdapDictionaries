\details{
\href{http://www.lextek.com/manuals/onix/stopwords2.html}{From Onix Text Retrieval Toolkit API Reference}:
"This stopword list was built by Gerard Salton and Chris Buckley for the
experimental SMART information retrieval system at Cornell University.
This stopword list is generally considered to be on the larger side and so
when it is used, some implementations edit it so that it is better suited
for a given domain and audience while others use this stopword list as it
stands."
