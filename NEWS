Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch



qdapDictionaries 1.0.6
----------------------------------------------------------------

A named index was used in the internal function `left.just` producing an `NA`.
This caused an error to be thrown in **R Under development (unstable) (2015-05-19 r68384)**.


qdapDictionaries 1.0.5
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `contractions` did not contain "we've" but erroneously contained "what did" 
  rather than "what'd" and "when" rather than "when'd" = "when did".

* The data sets `emoticon` and `abbreviations` had the columns stored as `factor`.  
  These columns have been changed to `character`.

NEW FEATURES

* `function.words` a list of function words added from: http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/wordscape/museum/funcword.html

* `discourse.markers.alemany` a list of Aalemany's (2005) discourse markers 
  added from: http://www.cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~laura/shallowdisc4summ/tesi_electronica.pdf

CHANGES

* The **qdap** package is no longer in Suggests: in the DESCRIPTION file.


qdapDictionaries 1.0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `key.syn` contained antonyms and elements that were error messages (character).
  This has been fixed.  Reference issue #2. (Jingjing Zou)

NEW FEATURES

* `GradyAugmented` was added.  This augmented Grady data set is a large list of 
 known English words and proper nouns.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `contractions` data set picks up 3 words: "it'll", "'cause", & "there'll".


qdapDictionaries 1.0.0 - 1.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

The removal of environments and addition of keys (name change from env.XXX to 
key.XXX) may cause a break with backward compatibility, hence the major version 
bump to 1.0.0.

CHANGES

* The `env.syl`, `env.pol`, `env.power`, `env.strength`, and `env.syn` have been 
  converted from environments to `data.table` based hash keys and renamed to 
  `key.syl`, `key.pol`, `key.power`, `key.strength`, and `key.syn`.


qdapDictionaries 0.0.4
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

*  The following sentiment related data sets have been added: `strong.words`, 
  `weak.words`, `power.words`, `submit.words`, `env.strength`, `env.power`.


qdapDictionaries 0.0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

First version sent to CRAN

qdapDictionaries 0.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

The dictionaries and word lists previously found in **qdap** have been moved to a separate package, qdapDictionaries.  This is the first instalment of the package.
